    <h4>Here's a time line of Tesla's life:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1856</span> - Born on July 10, 1856, to a Serbian family in Smiljan then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire now in Croatia</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1875</span> - Enrolled to study engineering at Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1882</span> - Started working for Continental Edison in Paris. While working, identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle, which is used today in alternators</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1883</span> - Sent to Strasbourg, Paris to fix damaged lighting system installed at German Railway company. Repairs approved but Tesla never received the compensation</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1884</span> - Took a boat to USA</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1885</span> - Approached by inventors to develop improved  arc lighting system, in exchange for financing to form Tesla Electric Light Company. After project completion, Tesla was forced out of company, which he later described as "the hardest blow" he'd ever received </li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1886</span> - Left with nothing but some worthless certificates, Tesla had to work as a  ditch digger </li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1887</span> - Started working on alternated current system funded by Alfred S. Brown director of Western Union in exchange for fifty fifty patent split</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1890</span> - Developed first neon and fluorescent illumination. Began experimenting with x-rays and took some of the very first x-rays photos. He also illuminated a vacuum tube wirelessly by transferring energy through air </li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1891</span> - Patented Tesla Coil which is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla became citizen of the United States same year</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1893</span> - Joined with George Westinghouse, Tesla's alternating current powers Columbian exhibition</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1894</span> - Voted member of the Serbian Royal Academy of Belgrade</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1899</span> - Moved his research lab to Colorado Springs to have larger space</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1901</span> - Began construction on Wardenclyffe Tower to demonstrate how electrical energy could be transmitted without the need for power lines. The project initially backed by J.P.Morgan who later didn't see any financial gain as the electricity couldn't be metered without powerlines, withdrew backing and discouraged other investors as well. Left without funding, project was never completed</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1913</span> - Patented blade turbine</li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1915</span> - Filed lawsuit against Guglielmo Marconi for radio transmission patent infringement </li>
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">1943</span> - died of heart failure at the age of 86 </li>
        </ul>
